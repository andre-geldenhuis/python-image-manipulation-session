Hi chat, I want to proceses more than 100,000 images in python.  My project is located at 
/nfs/scratch/geldenan/WellingtonCameraTraps

I'd like my code to reside there, the images I want to process are all in one huge directory at /nfs/scratch/geldenan/WellingtonCameraTraps/images/images

I'd like to crop the bottom 100 pixels off the images.  I have a small test dataset at /nfs/scratch/geldenan/WellingtonCameraTraps/example_images we could test on first?

>Sure, we can use the Pillow library in Python to accomplish this. Below is a simple example of how you can process the images. Let's start by writing a function to crop one image:
>
>```python
>from PIL import Image
>
>def crop_image(input_image_path, output_image_path):
>    """
>    Crop the bottom 100 pixels off an image.
>    """
>    image = Image.open(input_image_path)
>    width, height = image.size
>    new_height = height - 100  # subtract 100 pixels from the original height
>    image = image.crop((0, 0, width, new_height))  # parameters are left, upper, right, lower
>    image.save(output_image_path)
>```
>
>Then, you can write another function that goes through each image in a directory and applies this cropping function:
>
>```python
>import os
>
>def process_images(input_dir, output_dir):
>    """
>    Process all images in a directory.
>    """
>    # Make the output directory if it doesn't already exist
>    os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)
>
>    for filename in os.listdir(input_dir):
>        if filename.endswith(".jpg") or filename.endswith(".png"): 
>            input_image_path = os.path.join(input_dir, filename)
>            output_image_path = os.path.join(output_dir, filename)
>            crop_image(input_image_path, output_image_path)
>            print(f'Processed {filename}')
>        else:
>            continue
>```
>
>You can first test this code with your small test dataset:
>
>```python
>input_dir = "/nfs/scratch/geldenan/WellingtonCameraTraps/example_images"
>output_dir = "/nfs/scratch/geldenan/WellingtonCameraTraps/cropped_images"
>
>process_images(input_dir, output_dir)
>```

>After verifying that everything works as expected, you can then apply this to your full dataset. Remember to change `input_dir` and `output_dir` to the directories where your full dataset is stored and where you want to save the processed images, respectively.

>One more thing: because you're dealing with a large amount of images, consider parallelizing this process to speed it up. You could use libraries like `multiprocessing` in Python to accomplish this. Also, make sure your code handles exceptions properly -- you don't want it to crash halfway through processing 100,000 images.
