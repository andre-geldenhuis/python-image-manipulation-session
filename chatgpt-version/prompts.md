Hi chat, I want to proceses more than 100,000 images in python.  My project is located at 
/nfs/scratch/geldenan/WellingtonCameraTraps

I'd like my code to reside there, the images I want to process are all in one huge directory at /nfs/scratch/geldenan/WellingtonCameraTraps/images/images

I'd like to crop the bottom 100 pixels off the images.  I have a small test dataset at /nfs/scratch/geldenan/WellingtonCameraTraps/example_images we could test on first?

>Sure, we can use the Pillow library in Python to accomplish this. Below is a simple example of how you can process the images. Let's start by writing a function to crop one image:
>
>```python
>from PIL import Image
>
>def crop_image(input_image_path, output_image_path):
>    """
>    Crop the bottom 100 pixels off an image.
>    """
>    image = Image.open(input_image_path)
>    width, height = image.size
>    new_height = height - 100  # subtract 100 pixels from the original height
>    image = image.crop((0, 0, width, new_height))  # parameters are left, upper, right, lower
>    image.save(output_image_path)
>```
>
>Then, you can write another function that goes through each image in a directory and applies this cropping function:
>
>```python
>import os
>
>def process_images(input_dir, output_dir):
>    """
>    Process all images in a directory.
>    """
>    # Make the output directory if it doesn't already exist
>    os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)
>
>    for filename in os.listdir(input_dir):
>        if filename.endswith(".jpg") or filename.endswith(".png"): 
>            input_image_path = os.path.join(input_dir, filename)
>            output_image_path = os.path.join(output_dir, filename)
>            crop_image(input_image_path, output_image_path)
>            print(f'Processed {filename}')
>        else:
>            continue
>```
>
>You can first test this code with your small test dataset:
>
>```python
>input_dir = "/nfs/scratch/geldenan/WellingtonCameraTraps/example_images"
>output_dir = "/nfs/scratch/geldenan/WellingtonCameraTraps/cropped_images"
>
>process_images(input_dir, output_dir)
>```
>
>After verifying that everything works as expected, you can then apply this to your full dataset. Remember to change `input_dir` and `output_dir` to the directories where your full dataset is stored and where you want to save the processed images, respectively.
>
>One more thing: because you're dealing with a large amount of images, consider parallelizing this process to speed it up. You could use libraries like `multiprocessing` in Python to accomplish this. Also, make sure your code handles exceptions properly -- you don't want it to crash halfway through processing 100,000 images.

some of the images are capitalised JPG

>Ah, good point. We can modify the `process_images` function to be case-insensitive when checking for file extensions:
>
>```python
>def process_images(input_dir, output_dir):
>    """
>    Process all images in a directory.
>    """
>    # Make the output directory if it doesn't already exist
>    os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)
>
>    for filename in os.listdir(input_dir):
>        if filename.lower().endswith((".jpg", ".png")): 
>            input_image_path = os.path.join(input_dir, filename)
>            output_image_path = os.path.join(output_dir, filename)
>            crop_image(input_image_path, output_image_path)
>            print(f'Processed {filename}')
>        else:
>            continue
>```
>
>Now, the function will correctly process images regardless of whether their extensions are lowercase or uppercase.

I'd like to use a python virtual env for this, can you show me how to set it up and install the needed packages?

>Sure! It's a good idea to use a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies for your project.
>
>Firstly, navigate to your project directory:
>
>```bash
>cd /nfs/scratch/geldenan/WellingtonCameraTraps/
>```
>
>Create the virtual environment. If you're using python3, you should already have the `venv` module:
>
>```bash
>python3 -m venv env
>```
>
>This will create a new directory named `env` in your current directory, which will contain the Python executable files and a copy of the `pip` library which you can use to install other packages.
>
>Activate the environment:
>
>```bash
>source env/bin/activate
>```
>
>Your shell prompt will change to show the name of the activated environment. Now, when you install packages, they will be installed in the `env` directory, isolated from the global Python environment.
>
>Install the Pillow library which we need for image processing:
>
>```bash
>pip install pillow
>```
>
>Once you have installed the packages and are done with your work, you can deactivate the environment:
>
>```bash
>deactivate
>```
>
>The next time you want to work on your project, don't forget to activate the environment again with `source env/bin/activate`.

If I wanted to go though all the images, after cropping them and equalize their brightness histograms could we do that?  and saved them in a directory called equalized?  Maybe we could try and ensure that each image was a bright as the average

>Sure, we can use the `ImageOps.equalize` function from Pillow to equalize the histogram. This spreads out the most frequent intensity values in an image, enhancing the contrast. Note that this doesn't make each image as bright as the average; histogram equalization is a method of contrast adjustment using the image's histogram.
>
>Here's how you can modify the `crop_image` function to also equalize the histogram:
>
>```python
>from PIL import Image, ImageOps
>
>def crop_and_equalize_image(input_image_path, output_image_path):
>    """
>    Crop the bottom 100 pixels off an image and equalize its histogram.
>    """
>    image = Image.open(input_image_path)
>    width, height = image.size
>    new_height = height - 100  # subtract 100 pixels from the original height
>    image = image.crop((0, 0, width, new_height))  # parameters are left, upper, right, lower
>    
>    # equalize the histogram
>    image = ImageOps.equalize(image)
>    
>    image.save(output_image_path)
>```
>
>Then, you can call this function in your `process_images` function:
>
>```python
>def process_images(input_dir, output_dir):
>    """
>    Process all images in a directory.
>    """
>    # Make the output directory if it doesn't already exist
>    os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)
>
>    for filename in os.listdir(input_dir):
>        if filename.lower().endswith((".jpg", ".png")): 
>            input_image_path = os.path.join(input_dir, filename)
>            output_image_path = os.path.join(output_dir, filename)
>            crop_and_equalize_image(input_image_path, output_image_path)
>            print(f'Processed {filename}')
>        else:
>            continue
>```
>
>You can specify the output directory for the equalized images:
>
>```python
>input_dir = "/nfs/scratch/geldenan/WellingtonCameraTraps/images/images"
>output_dir = "/nfs/scratch/geldenan/WellingtonCameraTraps/equalized_images"
>
>process_images(input_dir, output_dir)
>```
>
>Again, I'd recommend testing this with your small dataset before running it on all your images. Also, remember that histogram equalization can sometimes produce unwanted results, especially when applied to natural images. Make sure to check the results to see if this method is appropriate for your specific dataset.
