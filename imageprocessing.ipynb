    "## Setup the initial Python Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "If you work on multiple Python projects, you'll likely have encountered Python virtual environments (venvs) and/or conda. You can think of these as ways to have a separate Python \"install\" or more accurately, an environment for each project. There are numerous reasons to use a venv or conda such as keeping different versions of a library separate. However, my favorite reason is reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you move to another computer, High-Performance Computing (HPC) system, or have a collaborator working with you, you'll need to know which versions of which libraries are necessary to install to make your project work. Venvs help solve this problem with requirements files. Conda can also save its environment. For this example, we'll use venvs and pip as they are lightweight and require less to install. That being said, Conda is a great option too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by creating a venv, assuming you have a fairly recent version of Python 3 installed, everything you need should already be included.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python3 -m venv env #create a venv called env\n",
    "\n",
    "ls #see the env folder\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To actually use the venv, you'll need to know some particular commands. These aren't too complicated and eventually, you'll remember them. There are helper scripts available to simplify this process, and Conda is also a bit simpler. We'll do it in a generic, lightweight way:\n",
