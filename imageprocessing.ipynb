    "Sometimes, you find yourself performing repetitive tasks on a computer. Since computers excel at handling repetitive tasks, we'll explore an example that involves manipulating tens of thousands of images. To make this session accessable to everyone the first half of the session will be in a pure browser jupyterlite session.  Afterward we will switch to local jupyter sessions, for those who have set that up, to use multiprocessing.\n",

    "* Using Jupyter notebooks for prototyping.\n",
    "    * Shifting the code to python functions for version controll and clarity.\n",
    "* Downloading and working with large datasets\n",

    "* Version controlling our code as we progress\n",
